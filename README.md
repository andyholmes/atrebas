This map does not represent or intend to represent official or legal boundaries
of any Indigenous nations. To learn about definitive boundaries, contact the
nations in question.

Also, this map is not perfect — it is a work in progress with tons of
contributions from the community. Please send us fixes if you find errors.

We strive to represent nations and Indigenous people on their own terms. When
there are conflicts or issues with our information, we try to fix things as soon
as possible with the input of all parties involved.


## Status

This project is in an alpha state. It generally works as intended, but is still
missing some features and may contain bugs. If that's okay with you, there is a
nightly [Flatpak build][nightly-repo] you can try out.
